## Data We Access

### Public Cinema Showtime Data

This data is:
- Already publicly accessible on cinema websites

### Movie Metadata (TMDB)
We fetch movie posters, ratings, and descriptions from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. TMDB may collect limited technical data as described in their [privacy policy](https://www.themoviedb.org/privacy-policy).

## Network Requests

The app makes network requests to:

1. **Our Backend API** (self-hosted)
   - Purpose: Fetch current showtime data
   - Data sent: None (no user identifiers)
   - Data received: Movie showtimes (public data)

2. **TMDB API** (themoviedb.org)
   - Purpose: Fetch movie metadata (posters, ratings)
   - Data sent: Movie titles (no user data)
   - Data received: Movie information (public data)

**No user-identifiable information is included in any network request.**

## Third-Party Services

### The Movie Database (TMDB)

## Children's Privacy

VoseMovies does not knowingly collect data from children under 13 (or 16 in the EU). Since we collect no personal data from anyone, the app is safe for all ages. However, movie content ratings should be reviewed by parents/guardians.

## Your Rights (GDPR Compliance)

Under GDPR and other privacy laws, you have rights regarding your data. Since VoseMovies does not collect personal data, most rights are not applicable. However:

- **Right to Access:** No personal data is collected, so there is nothing to access.
- **Right to Deletion:** Uninstalling the app removes all local data.
- **Right to Object:** You can stop using the app at any time.
- **Right to Complain:** Contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns.

## Data Security

While we do not collect personal data, we implement security best practices:
- Backend API uses HTTPS encryption
- No user authentication means no password breaches
- Local cache is device-encrypted (by Android OS)
- No centralized user database

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in:
- App functionality
- Legal requirements
- Best practices

**Notification:** Significant changes will be announced via:
- In-app notification
- Updated "Last Modified" date above
- GitHub repository update log

**Your Consent:** Continued use of the app after policy changes constitutes acceptance.

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no retention policy. Local cache is automatically refreshed every 24 hours and is deleted when you uninstall the app.

## International Data Transfers

VoseMovies is designed for users in the Balearic Islands (Spain, EU). Our backend server is located in [specify location]. Since no personal data is collected, GDPR international transfer provisions do not apply.
